ASYNCIO basics

  A. What is asynchronous Input/Output processing
    -- Asynchronous input output is a form of input output processing that allows others devices to do processing before the transmission or data transfer is done.
       Asyncio the Python package that provides a foundation and API for running and managing coroutines.
       
    -- Asynchronous programming is a type of programming in which we can execute more than one task without blocking the Main task (function). 
       In Python, there are many ways to execute more than one function concurrently, one of the ways is by using asyncio. Async programming allows
       you to write concurrent code that runs in a single thread.

    -- Coroutine: Coroutines are a general control structure whereby flow control is cooperatively passed between two different routines without
       returning. In asyncio Coroutine can be created by using async keyword before def.
