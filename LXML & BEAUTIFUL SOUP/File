3. Parsing HTML using Parsel
Ans:
    from parsel import Selector
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    print('=== HTML ===')
    html = '''<li>
     one
     <div>
    </li>
    <li>
     two
    </li>'''
    print(html)

    print('=== parsel (lxml) (marginal interpretation) ===')
    sel = Selector(text=html)
    print(sel.extract())

    print('=== html.parser ===')
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    print(soup.prettify())

    print('=== lxml (same problem as parsel of course) ===')
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')
    print(soup.prettify())

    print('=== html5lib (Parses pages the same way a web browser does) ===')
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html5lib')
    print(soup.prettify())

  C. How to extract text, attributes using xpaths

  D. How to use conditions in XPaths
  -- The expression text() will return true for an element that contains text. You may also use XPath to create a test that will evaluate 
     the result of an ACL or a JavaScript script. To add an XPath expression as a condition, select New XPath Test in the Condition dialog box,
     and type the expression in the resulting field.

  E. Filtering results based on if an attribute or text contains a substring
  -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1198253/xpath-how-to-select-elements-based-on-their-value
  
  F. Relative XPaths
  -- The relative xpath starts by referring to the element that we want to identify and not from the root node. A relative xpath starts with the // symbol.
     It is mainly used for automation since even if an element is removed or added in the DOM, the relative xpath is not impacted.
  
  
5. CSS Selectors
  -- CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select
     HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.
