1. What is JS?
  -- JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.
     Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
  
2. What is ajax requests and why it is used to load pages dynamically ( Just learn how it is being done, no need to go into details)
  -- An AJAX request is a request made by an AJAX application. Typically, it is an HTTP request made by (browser-resident)
     Javascript that uses XML to encode the request data and/or response data.

  -- AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. AJAX allows web pages to be updated
     asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of 
     a web page, without reloading the whole page.
     
  -- Dynamic Loading: 
     Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the 
     addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.
