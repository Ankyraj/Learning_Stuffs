1. What are headers?
  -- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-headers/
  
  -- HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of
     its case-insensitive name followed by a colon ( : ), then by its value.
  
  
2. What is the purpose of User-Agent headers?
  -- The User-Agent request header is a characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, 
     operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.

3. What is the purpose of the referer header?
  -- The Referer header allows servers to identify where people are visiting them from, which can then be used for analytics, logging,
     optimized caching, and more. The Referer header may not contain URL fragments (i.e. "#section") or "username:password" information.
