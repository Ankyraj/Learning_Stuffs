HTTP: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_overview.htm
  A. Basics
  -- The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
     This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol
     which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.
  -- Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on 
     the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to 
     communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how
     the servers respond to these requests.
     
     
  B. Requests
  -- An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server.
     To make the request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which includes the information needed to access the resource.

  C. Responses
  -- An HTTP response is made by a server to a client. The aim of the response is to provide the client with the resource it requested, or inform the 
     client that the action it requested has been carried out; or else to inform the client that an error occurred in processing its request.

  D. Methods
  -- The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD)
     operations, respectively.

  E. Status codes
  -- The Status-Code element in a server response, is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last
     two digits do not have any categorization role.


  F. Header Fields
  -- HTTP header fields are components of the header section of request and response messages in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). They define the 
     operating parameters of an HTTP transaction.

  G. Caching
  -- Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. When a web cache has a requested resource in its store,
     it intercepts the request and returns its copy instead of re-downloading from the originating server.

  H. URL Encoding
  -- HTTP URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set, which often contain characters outside the ASCII set. So these unsafe characters
     must be replaced with a % followed by two hexadecimal digits.
