1. Introduction to Python Requests module
  -- Python requests module has several built-in methods to make Http requests to specified URI using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or HEAD requests.
     A Http request is meant to either retrieve data from a specified URI or to push data to a server. It works as a request-response protocol
     between a client and a server.
